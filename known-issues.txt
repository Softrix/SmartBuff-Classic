WOTLK Beta Issues:

As of 19/07/2022, Theres a known issue on API call IsSpellInRange where it is always returning nil as if the wrong 
parameters have been provided - it should be returning 1 if a player is in range and 0 if he/she is out of range.

Try:   IsSpellInRange("Arcane Brilliance", "player") on a mage.


Issue also present on priest, checking others.


*added a quick hack for wotlk, removed range checking temporary.
